# React Router v6 Intermittent Routing Bug

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered when using React Router v6.  A specific route, '/contact', intermittently renders the Home component instead of the intended Contact component. The problem is not consistent and occurs seemingly at random.

## Bug Description
The issue is observed in a simple React application using React Router v6.  The routing configuration includes routes for '/', '/about', and '/contact'.  While '/' and '/about' route correctly, '/contact' sometimes unexpectedly renders the Home component. 

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Navigate to '/contact'.  Observe that the Contact component sometimes does not render and the Home component appears instead.  Refresh the page and the behavior may change. 

## Potential Causes
Preliminary investigation suggests that the problem might be related to component lifecycles or state updates which interfere with the routing mechanisms, although this is purely speculative.
